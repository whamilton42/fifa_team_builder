# FIFA team builder

Inspired by a [Football Weekly episode](http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/audio/2014/oct/09/football-weekly-extra-podcast-listen-now) with the question: *what's the best team you can build out of players whose surname starts with the same letter?*

## Usage

`bundle`
`ruby bin/scrape.rb`
`ruby bin/print.rb --team first_letter_of_surname`

## Data

You can get ahold of the data from anywhere. I'm scraping from `http://www.futhead.com/15/players/`. Don't run the scape command too often - it's not cool.
